### Project Overview
* **Role**: ML Intern
* **Location**: San Jose
* **Duration**: 08/2024 - 03/2025

### Key Contributions
* **Latency Optimization**: Engineered a high-performance resume generation pipeline, migrating from GPT-4o API to a self-hosted **Llama 3** model served via **vLLM**.
* **Performance Impact**: Achieved a **67% reduction in generation latency** (from 15s to 5s) and slashed operational costs by 30%.
* **Prompt Engineering**: Designed a 5-step prompt chain incorporating **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** to improve rewriting accuracy.
* **Semantic Search**: Leveraged fine-tuned LLMs (DeepSeek, GPT-4) to power semantic search across 40+ dimensions.
