I am an undergraduate student at Shanghai University's School of Computer Engineering and Science, focusing on artificial intelligence and software engineering. My research interests span vehicle network security, meteorological applications, and AI system optimization. Currently, I work as an intern at OpenJobs AI, developing intelligent solutions for job search and recruitment. 

Research Focus
======
My research combines theoretical foundations with practical applications across several domains:

Vehicle Network Security
Working with the Cybersecurity Lab Vehicle Communication System Modeling and Simulation Group, I contribute to developing advanced detection systems for vehicle network attacks. Our work includes designing and implementing the Sequence Mapping Block (SMB) with OneHot encoding, significantly improving model convergence in anomaly detection.

Meteorological Applications
At the East China Air Traffic Management Bureau, I research deep learning applications for meteorological forecasting and super-resolution. This work involves comparing and optimizing various state-of-the-art models, including RVRT and BasicVSR++, while incorporating optical flow techniques for enhanced accuracy.
