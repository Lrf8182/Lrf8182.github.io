* **B.S. in Computer Science**, Shanghai University (SHU), 2021 - 2025 

Professional Experience
======
* **SDE Intern, OpenJobs AI** (San Jose), Aug 2024 - Mar 2025 
  * Engineered a high-performance resume generation pipeline, migrating from GPT-4o API to a self-hosted, fine-tuned **Llama 3** served via **vLLM**.
  * Achieved a **67% reduction in generation latency** (from 15s to 5s) and slashed operational costs by 30%.
  * Developed a 5-step prompt chain incorporating **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** to improve rewriting accuracy.
  * Leveraged fine-tuned LLMs (DeepSeek, GPT-4) to power semantic search across 40+ dimensions.

* **IT Intern, Yum China** (Shanghai), Jan 2024 - May 2024 
  * Supported the development of an enterprise **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system, handling data scraping, embedding, and model evaluation.
  * Developed a PoC using **Stable Diffusion** and **ComfyUI** for automated marketing asset generation, producing 100+ sample images.
  * Maintained a customer satisfaction platform serving thousands of users, utilizing **Docker** to ensure 99.8% uptime.

Research Experience
======
* **Research Assistant, East China Air Traffic Management Bureau** 
  * Proposed a meteorological super-resolution model fusing VSR temporal attention with UNet spatial hierarchy.
